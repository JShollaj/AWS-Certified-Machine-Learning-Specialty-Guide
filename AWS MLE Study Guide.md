This is a summarized version of the most important topics derived from the official exam guide. Here we follow step by step each key word from the document and bring a high level description and definition for each of them. We have the following main domains to study from:  

## Domain 1: Data Engineering

Identify and compare storage mediums, classes and data sources. Know the difference between data engineering concepts such as data lakes, batch load vs streaming data.

## Domain 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Learn how to deal with missing/corrupt data and various preprocessing techniques for NLP/CV. Learn interpretive descriptive statistics and appropriate graphing

## Domain 3: Modeling

Learn when and how to use each algorithm for specific use cases. Main focus on main terms and important concepts such as optimizers, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

## Domain 4: Machine Learning Implementation

Focus on productionizing maintainable and secure ML models through AWS services. Decide when to use out of the box ML models instead of building your own. Learn MLOPs architectures.

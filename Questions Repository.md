# List of Potential Questions

This is a list of all questions I could gather from all the sources I used. You can DM me for the solutions.

1. A data engineer needs to create a cost-effective data pipeline solution that ingests unstructured data from various sources and stores it for downstream analytics applications and ML. The solution should include a data store where the processed data is highly available for at least one year, so that data analysts and data scientists can run analytics and ML workloads on the most recent data. For compliance reasons, the solution should include both processed and raw data. The raw data does not need to be accessed regularly, but when needed, should be accessible within 24 hours.

   **What solution should the data engineer deploy?**

2. An ad-tech company has hired a data engineer to create and maintain a machine learning pipeline for its clickstream data. The data will be gathered from various sources, including on premises, and will need to be streamed to the companyâ€™s Amazon EMR instances for further processing.

   **What service or combination of services can the company use to meet these requirements?**

3. A healthcare company using the AWS Cloud has access to a variety of data types, including raw and preprocessed data. The company wants to start using this data for its ML pipeline, but also wants to make sure the data is highly available and located in a centralized repository.

   **What approach should the company take to achieve the desired outcome?**
